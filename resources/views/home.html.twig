                        The Upkar project provides high-quality education to rural children in an integrated manner.
                        We aim to give them equal opportunities to learn as others, supported by the best of learning tools and environment.
                        So that they go on to become change makers by breaking the vicious cycle of poverty,
                        illiteracy, and improper hygiene and sanitation; allowing the students to contribute towards India’s transformation
                        so that children can be transformed in their personal, work, society and physical life enabling them to contribute
                        towards India’s transformation.

                    <p>
                        At The Upkar Project, child centric approach is the driving force of everything we do– from curriculum design to how
                        our premises looks. We have taken into consideration that every space and activity provides a full measure of opportunities
                        for the children to learn and thrive. Each day is a combination of individual and group activities, outdoor and indoor
                        activities aimed at integrated development of a child. On the whole our aim at the project is to blossom a child's
                        personality by making the most of the formative years in an ideal learning environment.
